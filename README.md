# Horiseon-refactor

##Description

For this challenge I have thoroughly combed the code for the Horiseon site and refactored it. Most of the elements were labeled as <div>, which did not describe their contents. Many of the images also did not have alt elements, so I have added those to the code as well. The website was orignally titled "website" instead of describing the contents of the site. Because of the class element in the "<h1>" line, it would have been difficult for search engines to locate the site, had I not changed it.
